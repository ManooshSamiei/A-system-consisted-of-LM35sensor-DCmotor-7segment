# A-system-consisted-of-LM35sensor-DCmotor-7segment
In this project, a system consisted of AT mega 32, LM35 sensor, 7 segments, and DC motor is constructed. The 3 seven segments show the temperature of the environment, measured by LM35 sensor, up to 1 decimal point. The rotational speed of DC motor varies according to the temperature of the environment. Its maximum speed is in 90 centigrade and minimum speed is in 0 centigrade. The computer shows the temperature, time, and date, received from the microcontroller using USART communication. It is also possible to set the speed of the DC motor manually, and show a desired temperature manually on the segments, using the computerâ€™s serial communication.   This system has separated settings for time, date, motor speed, and segments. The user can change all these settings on the ATmega32 microcontroller, using USART communication.
